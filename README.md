# pmdrtmr-frontend

## Overview

This repository includes the frontend of my Pomodoro timer project pmdrtmr, which I build during my work placement at the [KDO](https://www.kdo.de/).

## Dependencies

I generally try to minimize dependencies, but I'm a one man crew and can therefore only support Ubuntu as I'm running it myself. Anyway, you need to have the following packages installed for everything to work properly:

- NodeJS as the development base. Install it with `sudo snap install node --classic`.
- VSCodium as universal text editor and IDE. Install it with `sudo snap install codium --classic`.
- Firefox for viewing the website. Install it with `sudo snap install firefox`.

## How to use it

First install the neede packages via `npm install`. Then run the program directly via `npm run dev` or build it via `npm run build` and then run it via `npm run start`.
